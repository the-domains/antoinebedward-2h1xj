  I approach learning design like a blank canvas. Every course I design is an
  opportunity to help an individual reach a new height. After discovering my
  passion for helping people through health and fitness, I set out to find a new
  medium in which I could further contribute to the wellbeing of others. The
  medium? Distance learning.

I approach learning design like a blank canvas. Every course I design is an opportunity to help an individual reach a new height. After discovering my passion for helping people through health and fitness, I set out to find a new medium in which I could further contribute to the wellbeing of others. The medium? Distance learning.

I completed my Master of Education at Athabasca University. There I wrote a thesis entitled _Comparing the Effect of Support on Student Satisfaction in Online and Face-to-face Universities which you may access [here][0]._

Currently, I am completing my Philosophical Doctorate in Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto.
