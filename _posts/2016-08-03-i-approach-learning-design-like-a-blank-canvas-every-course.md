  I approach learning design like a blank canvas. Every course I design is an
  opportunity to help an individual reach a new height. After discovering my
  passion for helping people through health and fitness, I set out to find a new
  medium in which I could further contribute to the wellbeing of others. The
  medium? Distance learning.

I approach learning design like a blank canvas. Every course I design is an opportunity to help an individual reach a new height. After discovering my passion for helping people through health and fitness, I set out to find a new medium in which I could further contribute to the wellbeing of others. The medium? Distance learning.

I completed my Master of Education at Athabasca University. There I wrote a thesis entitled _Comparing the Effect of Support on Student Satisfaction in Online and Face-to-face Universities which you may access [here][0]._

Currently, I am completing my Philosophical Doctorate in Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto.

> Learning and Educating are big parts of my life, and Toronto is the best place for me right now.

I recently returned from a research trip to East Africa with my team. We are exploring the current status of online learning focused around engineering education in Africa. Throughout this trip, we met with the African Virtual University, Kenyatta University, the University of Nairobi, the University of Rwanda and many more.
