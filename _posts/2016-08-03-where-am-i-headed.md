# About me...

I received my Hon. B. Sc. degree in Human Kinetics at the University of Ottawa in 2009\. My love for coaching and teaching in both the public and private sectors encouraged me to pursue my Master's degree in Education at Athabasca University. Under the supervision of Prof. Tom Jones, I conducted a comparison study of the level of student satisfaction with the support received in face to face versus online undergraduate courses.

> Apparently I love to learn and Toronto is the best place for me to do that.

In September 2015, I began my doctorate degree studying online learning environments at theOntarioInstitute for Studies inEducation at the University of Toronto. I added on the Engineering Education collaborative program to my degree because of the important role engineering plays in the world we live today. My research is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of how the design of online learning environments can support learners. My professional portfolio includes instructional design in subjects such as educational technology,mental health, political science, human resources,earth science and engineering.

> Where am I headed?

As I continue to observe and analyze the field of education and online learning, I can already see the realization of the possibilities. Online platforms are offering university-certified MBAs at a fraction of the cost, students are defining their own learning needs in the online courses they sign up for and private industries continue to hack the education system in order to provide greater access and open up the doors of the _Ivory Towers_ of traditional academia. I am not sure what it all means, but I plan to be there every step of the way trying to figure it.
